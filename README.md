#### MATLAB simulation for Control of Quadrotor Helicopter

MATLAB simulation for Control of Quadrotor Helicopter using Linear Control Theories for hovering condition.The design and implementation of an autopilot/flight controller for the Quanser Qball-X4, a quadrotor helicopter. This is accomplished by developing nonlinear and linearized mathematical models to represent the system, utilizing functions available in MATLAB and Simulink. The model is equipped with several control features, such as a Height Control, Roll Control, Pitch Control, Yaw Control, Actuator Control, in addition to an ùë•Ãá and ùë¶Ãá controls so the vehicle can follow a rectangular and/or a circular trajectory.The models developed also consider uncertainties through the introduction of noise to the system for a more realistic scenario. Lastly, the model mentioned can be described as a continuous model, as such, a discretized model was created to mimic the physical model, since, realistically, inputs to the system will only be available at sampled time values.
